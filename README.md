# frontend-lcd
Front door of Screendoor for LCD/buttons

To run the frontend, just use "python frontend.py"

To move around through the menus, you can use the keyboard arrow keys to go up and down as well as enter to select and backspace to go back. In its current state, pressing enter will only do something when the "settings" block is selected and backspace will only do something when you are in the settings menu.
